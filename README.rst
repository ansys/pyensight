About
-----

This repository contains the pythonic API to EnSight, the Ansys Post
Processor. This API allows the user to start an EnSight session, or
connect to an existing one. Send your simulation data to the session,
and drive the post processing in a pythonic fashion. The user can then
choose to visualize the processed data, extract it, or get a widget to
embed in an external application.

Project Overview
----------------
Provide a description of your PyAnsys Python library.


Installation
------------
Include installation directions.  Note that this README will be
included in your PyPI package, so be sure to include ``pip``
directions along with developer installation directions.  For example.

Install <PyAnsys Library> with:

.. code::

   pip install ansys-<product/service>-<library>

Alternatively, clone and install in development mode with:

.. code::

   git clone https://github.com/pyansys/
   cd <PyAnsys-Library>
   pip install poetry
   poetry install

This creates a new virtual environment, which can be activated with

.. code::

   poetry shell

Documentation
-------------
Include a link to the full sphinx documentation.  For example `PyAnsys <https://docs.pyansys.com/>`_


Usage
-----
It's best to provide a sample code or even a figure demonstrating the usage of your library.  For example:

.. code:: python

   >>> from ansys.<product/service> import <library>
   >>> my_object.<library>()
   >>> my_object.foo()
   'bar'


Testing
-------
You can feel free to include this at the README level or in CONTRIBUTING.md
