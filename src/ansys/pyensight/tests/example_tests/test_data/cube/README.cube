This MPGS5 data set simulates internal heat flow and temperature 
distributation over a cube object.

The model consists of 8872 nodes and 7512 cells.

This data set originated as a test case courtesy of FIDAP, and 
subsequently translated to MPGS format.  This data set has had 
some corrections made to it based on new features that we added 
to MPGS 5.1.1 and later.
