# ANSYS Omniverse Geometry Service GUI [ansys.geometry.serviceui]

This Omniverse extension is a UI interface to the [ansys.geometry.service]
kit extension.  It allows an Omniverse application user to connect to
a running copy of ANSYS EnSight or other application that supports the
Dynamic Scene Graph gRPC protocol.  The GUI allows for the remote scene
to be pulled, on request,  into a specified Omniverse location.
