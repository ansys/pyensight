# ANSYS Tools Omniverse Core [ansys.tools.omniverse.core]

The Omniverse extension provides a dynamic connection between an ANSYS
geometry source (e.g. ANSYS EnSight) and an Omniverse instance. It can
also be launched via pyensight and via a simple GUI provided by
the [ansys.tools.omniverse.dsgui] kit extension.

For more details on this extension see:
