# ANSYS Omniverse Geometry Service [ansys.geometry.service]

The Omniverse extension provides a dynamic connection between an ANSYS
geometry source (e.g. ANSYS EnSight) and an Omniverse instance.  The
connection runs as a standalone service capable of supporting scripted
execution utilizing just a kit CLI.  It can also be launched via 
PyEnSight and via a simple GUI provided by the [ansys.geometry.serviceui]
kit extension.
