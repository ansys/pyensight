EnSight command language native Python API
==========================================

Since its inception, EnSight has had a journaling language, commonly referred to as
the *command language*. Every operation in EnSight can be captured in command language.
Scripts can be generated using this language and played back in the GUI or in batch mode.
Furthermore, features like context files (that capture a session state) do so using
a command language variant. Command language is not documented, but it roughly follows
the :ref:`EnSight architecture <ensight_architecture>`. The *native* Python API
is a binding to this command language interface.

Command language overview
-------------------------

A command language call has this general form: :samp:`{class}: {command} [values...]`.
For example, :samp:`view_transf: rotate -4. 24. 0.` rotates the current view and
:samp:`data: replace data.case` loads a dataset into the current case. Commands
may also follow a *begin/end* or *modify begin/end* structure where commands of the
same class are used between the begin and end commands. This form is used to *batch*
a collection of changes into a single update operation. Finally, there is a
*select begin/end* form for expanding values onto multiple lines.

The language separates the specification of target objects and attribute changes into
separate commands. Thus, there is always a *current selection* of all objects of
a specific type, and many commands operate on the current selection. For example,
this code sets the current part selection to part number 1 and then modifies the
line width and part color::

    part: select_begin
     1
    part: select_end
    part: modify_begin
    part: line_width 2
    part: colorby_rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0
    part: modify_end


.. note::
   While most of the command language follows these two command forms, there are a
   number of commands that do not follow this form.

As noted previously, EnSight maintains a *default* object of every type. Commands
can be used to modify most attributes on the default object. A *create*
command can then be used to create a new object instance. For example, the
following code creates a clip by selecting the default clip object and then setting
up the type and clip position value on the default clip. It then changes the current
part selection to what parts should become the parent of the clip and calls
:samp:`clip: create` to create the clip::

    clip: select_default
    clip: begin
    clip: domain intersect
    clip: tool xyz
    clip: value 0.5
    clip: end
    part: select_begin
     1
     2
    part: select_end
    clip: create


PyEnSight command language binding
----------------------------------

The *native* Python API binding is a simple syntax conversion from command language
into Python syntax. The command class is a module in Python under the ``session.ensight``
module. All values are passed as native Python parameters. For the *select/begin/end*
command form, only the ``begin`` command is used. All of the value lines can be specified
as Python parameters or a list. The previous example becomes this Python script:

.. code-block:: python

    session.ensight.clip.select_default()
    session.ensight.clip.begin()
    session.ensight.clip.domain("intersect")
    session.ensight.clip.tool("xyz")
    session.ensight.clip.value(0.5)
    session.ensight.clip.end()
    session.ensight.part.select_begin(1, 2)
    session.ensight.clip.create()


Lists of objects can be used where multiple values are specified
as parameters, which means that this syntax is also valid:

.. code-block:: python

    session.ensight.part.select_begin([1, 2])
    session.ensight.part.modify_begin()
    session.ensight.part.colorby_rgb([0.0, 0.0, 1.0])
    session.ensight.part.modify_end()


Every command also returns an error code, which is ``0`` on success. For example,
:samp:`err = session.ensight.part.colorby_rgb([0.0,0.0,"sad"])` sets ``err`` to ``-1``.
This code shows how you can also arrange to have error return values converted
into exceptions:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        ensight.sendmesgoptions(exception=True)
        ensight.part.select_begin([1, 2])
        ensight.part.colorby_rgb([0.0,0.0,"sad"])
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print("Error", e)
    finally:
        ensight.sendmesgoptions(exception=False)

This code prints this error:

:samp:`RuntimeError: Command: (part: colorby_rgb 0.0 0.0 sad ) returned: RGB color: bad parameter`

GUI conversion
--------------
There is a built-in mechanism to convert code in command language into Python. To do this,
you first paste the command language into the Python editor. On EnSight's **Execution** tab,
you can use the right-mouse button menu to select and copy lines of command language.

Next, select the text in the editor and use the **Edit** menu to select either
the **Convert selection to sendmesg()** or **Convert selection to native Python**
option. In general, the native Python conversion results in much more readable Python code
that is far easier to edit than the **Convert selection to sendmesg()** option. The
**Convert selection to native Python** option should be used for all but legacy development.

The **File** menu provides two items to execute the current file text in the EnSight Python
interpreter. The **Run script** option causes the file contents to be executed in the global
namespace (for example, like the ``execfile()`` function). The **Import script as module**
option first saves the current file to disk and then executes a Python import operation on the
file, which executes in a private namespace. Both options verify the syntax of the current
file and allow for rapid prototyping.

Special cases
-------------

There are a number of commands in the EnSight command language that are not valid
Python names. A few examples include::

    function: #_of_levels 5
    annotation: 3d_label_size 10.0
    command: print "hello"
    viewport: raise

Here are some reasons that a name might be invalid:

* Name contains an invalid character (such as ``#``).

* Name begins with a digit (such as ``1``).

* Name is a Python-reserved word (such as ``raise``).

Invalid names are transformed using these rules:

* ``#`` characters are replaced with the text *number*.

* Names that start with a digit are prefixed with an underscore (_).

* Names that are the same as a Python-reserved word are prefixed with an underscore (_).

The previous examples are transformed as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    session.ensight.function.number_of_levels(5)
    session.ensight.annotation._3d_label_size(10.0)
    session.ensight.command.print("hello")
    session.ensight.viewport._raise()


.. _selection_transfer:

Selection and the object API
----------------------------

The native API maintains a notion of a "current selection" with a collection
of commands to manipulate it, for example ``ensight.part.select_begin()``. The object API
reflects the EnSight GUI via SELECTED attributes and selection ENS_GROUP objects.
Due to the implicit nature of the native API, until it is used, the native selection
is not reflected in ensight objects. When using both APIs in a single script, it can
become necessary to synchronize the two notions of selection. This is done with the
the ``ensight.part.get_mainpartlist_select()`` command. This command sets the
native selection to match the object selection. It can be used like this:

.. code-block:: python

    p = session.ensight.objs.core.PARTS["rear body"][0]
    session.ensight.objs.core.selection().addchild(p, replace=1)
    session.ensight.part.get_mainpartlist_select()
    session.ensight.part.modify_begin()
    session.ensight.part.colorby_rgb(0.0,1.0,0.0)
    session.ensight.part.modify_end()


Which allows the object selection mechanisms to be used to set up the part selection
for subsequent native commands.
