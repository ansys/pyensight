No dependency on PyInstaller, omniverse_kit and pxr has been introduced yet in the pyproject.toml

To run the exporter:

1) In your Python environment run:

python -m pip install omniverse_kit --index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com/
The environment must be Python 3.10

2) Launch the application:
python usd_exporter/omni_core_app.py --help (this will show the command line options. Pretty straightforward. You will have to launch EnSight with a gRPC server on the side)

To build the exporter:

1) In your Python environment run:

python -m pip install pyinstaller

2) Run:

pyinstaller omni_core_app.spec
