this guide before attempting to contribute to PyEnSight.


Post issues

submit questions, report bugs, and request new features.


Adhere to code style
--------------------
PyEnSight is compliant with the `Coding style <https://dev.docs.pyansys.com/coding-style/index.html>`_
documented in the *PyAnsys Developer's Guide*. It uses a build target
to check the code style. You can verify the code style with this command:

.. code:: bash

   python pybuild.py precommit
