Adhere to code style

PyEnSight is compliant with the `Coding style <https://dev.docs.pyansys.com/coding-style/index.html>`_
documented in the *PyAnsys Developer's Guide*. It uses a build target
to verify the code style. You can use this command to verify the code style:

.. code:: bash

   pre-commit run --all-files
