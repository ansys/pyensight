EnSight and PyEnSight interfaces
--------------------------------

There is a Python interpreter embedded in the EnSight desktop app. In
general, this interpreter is referred to as EnSight or the *embedded interpreter*.
This interface is based on a built-in ``ensight`` module that cannot be imported
into any other interpreter. It is the fastest Python interface to EnSight, and
much of EnSight itself is written in Python running in this interpreter.

The other interface is PyEnSight. This interface is implemented as a portable
wheel and can be installed in most any Python interpreter. The interface provided
by this component resides in the ``ansys.pyensight`` module. It is a *remote* interface
in that it actually starts an independent EnSight instance in another process and
connects to it. Over this connection, the PyEnSight interface makes it possible
to execute Python commands in the embedded interpreter and return results.
Because the PyEnSight interface has a nearly identical API to the embedded interface,
code written for one interface basically works in the other interface, providing
that the code is structured properly. For information on API differences, see
:ref:`api_differences`.


History: Native and object APIs
-------------------------------

EnSight has always had a journaling language, often referred to
as the *command language* or *cmdlang*. This journaling language makes
it possible to view and review every interaction in EnSight as a command
stream. You can play back the journal streams to automate tasks.

The EnSight 9.x release introduced an embedded Python interpreter into the
EnSight core. The initial language binding to EnSight was via the *native API*. The
native API is derived from the EnSight journaling language. It is basically a direct
Python mapping with object-specific conversion operations to simplify the interface.
For more information, see :ref:`ref_cmdlang_native`. This interface is the most
complete interface to EnSight. The EnSight script editor provides tools for the
conversion of blocks of command language into this Python API.

As the sophistication of Python scripts increased, limitations in the
journal-based interface were exposed. In response, the *object API* was developed.
The object API is a direct interface to the core C++ EnSight objects. It is a
proxy interface that exposes C++ object attribute interfaces as Python
properties. The advantages of the object API is support for fine-grained
queries and event handling. For more information, see :ref:`ref_object_api`.
This API does not yet cover everything the native API does, but it
allows for using more interactive and reactive component interfaces.
Because of this, a significant portion of the EnSight GUI is written using
the EnSight object API.

.. _ensight_architecture:

EnSight architecture
--------------------

The EnSight Python APIs reflect the core EnSight architecture. Specifically,
they reflect the various objects inside of EnSight and their relationships.
The interface to these objects is largely a collection of properties. Note
that these are properties in the PyEnSight interface. The documentation for
the core interface refers to them as attributes and properties almost
interchangeably.

There are two types of objects in EnSight. The first set are parts of the code
that are generally created automatically at startup.

.. note::
   The following sections briefly describe many of the core classes. They do
   not describe all core classes but rather only commonly used objects.

There are two unique concepts in the EnSight architecture that are important
to explaining core EnSight behavior.

- The first is the idea of hierarchical property filtering.
- The second is the concept of default objects.


Hierarchical property filters
`````````````````````````````

A number of properties have *global* versions as well as *per-object* versions.
Often a specific visual property must be enabled globally before the
object-specific value can be applied. This can happen at different levels in
the visible object tree. Consider the ``HIDDENLINE`` property.
This property can be set on these levels: ``ENS_PART``, ``ENS_VPORT``, and
``ENS_GLOBAL``.

Here is an example in the object API::

    print(ensight.objs.core.HIDDENLINE)
    print(ensight.objs.core.VPORTS[0].HIDDENLINE)
    print(ensight.objs.core.PARTS[0].HIDDENLINE)

- If the ``HIDDENLINE`` property is set to ``False`` at the ``ENS_PART`` level, hidden
  lines are never shown on this part.
- If the ``HIDDENLINE`` property is set to ``False`` at the ``ENS_VPORT`` level, no
  hidden lines are shown on any parts that might be viable (and have the ``HIDDENLINE``
  property set to ``True``) in the specific ``ENS_VPORT`` level.
- If the ``HIDDENLINE`` property is set to ``False`` at the ``ENS_GLOBAL`` level
  (``ensight.objs.core``), no hidden lines are shown on any parts in any viewports.


Default objects
```````````````
The default object is a key concept for EnSight. To create an object in EnSight,
you often set up the properties on a fake *default* object and then make a *create*
call to realize a new object of this type. The new object has the same properties
as the current default object properties. For examples, see :ref:`ref_object_api`
and :ref:`ref_cmdlang_native`.


Common static objects
`````````````````````
There are a fixed number of each of the common static objects that are all allocated
statically at startup. The Python API allows you to modify the attributes on these objects
and query their statuses. The key object is ``ENS_GLOBAL``, which is accessed via
``ensight.objs.core``. Properties on the ``ENS_GLOBAL`` object can generally
access all of the other objects in the system. For descriptions of the properties on
these objects, see :ref:`ref_api_docs`.

================ ==================================================
Class            Description
================ ==================================================
|CAMERA|         ``CAMERA`` objects are used to set up views of the current
                 scene. They can be associated with viewports and attached to
                 polylines, nodes, and other graphics entities.
|CASE|           ``CASE`` objects are used to read a dataset. There are a
                 fixed number of ``CASE`` objects that can be active.
                 Each ``CASE`` object can load a dataset in a different format.
|GLOBALS|        The ``GLOBALS`` object provides an interface to the
                 core EnSight state. All objects can be accessed via
                 the properties on the ``GLOBALS`` object.
|LIGHTSOURCE|    The EnSight scene supports a finite number of
                 preallocated lighting sources. ``LIGHTSOURCE`` objects
                 provide the interface to the light properties.
|PROBE|          The ``PROBE`` object allows for creation of spatial data
                 probes. The result of probe queries can be
                 accessed via the ``PROBE`` object.
|TEXTURE|        The ``TEXTURE`` object maintains the pixel arrays that can
                 be applied via projective or explicit texture coordinates.
|TOOL|           ``Tool`` objects are spatial input devices in the scene. They
                 allow for the selection of points, regions of space,
                 reference lines or planes, and more. There are several
                 unique tool types. The PyEnSight API uses these
                 subclasses for each tool singleton.

                 =================== ===========================================
                 Subclass            Description
                 =================== ===========================================
                 |TOOL_BOX|          Box.
                 |TOOL_CONE|         Line segment with a base radius.
                 |TOOL_SPHERE|       Sphere.
                 |TOOL_CURSOR|       Single point.
                 |TOOL_CYLINDER|     Line segment with a fixed radius.
                 |TOOL_LINE|         Line segment.
                 |TOOL_PLANE|        Bounded plane.
                 |TOOL_REVOLUTION|   Line segment with a list of radii.
                 =================== ===========================================

|VPORT|          There are a fixed number of independent viewports.
                 Each ``VPORT`` object has an independent camera or projection.
                 The visibility of all 3D objects can be specified
                 independently for each viewport.
================ ==================================================


Common dynamic objects
``````````````````````

There are a fixed number of each common dynamic object that are all allocated
statically at startup. The Python API allows you to modify attributes on these
objects and query their statuses.

Many of the dynamically created objects are created implicitly through other
objects. For example, part objects are created from lpart objects and legend
objects are created automatically when variable objects are created. Other
objects (such as annotation objects and derived part objects like clips) are
created using *default* objects. For descriptions of the properties on
these objects, see :ref:`ref_api_docs`.

================ ==================================================
Class            Description
================ ==================================================
|ANNOT|          Provides the base class for annotation. Annotations are mostly
                 2D objects that overlay the 3D scene, such as text blocks and lines.
                 However, there are more complex types. For example, a legend annotation
                 is used to display the palette associated with a variable.
                 The PyEnSight API uses specific subclasses for each annotation
                 type.

                 =============== ===============================================
                 Subclass        Description
                 =============== ===============================================
                 |ANNOT_ARROW|   3D arrow pointing at a location in data space.
                 |ANNOT_DIAL|    Display of a constant variable as a dial.
                 |ANNOT_GAUGE|   Display of a constant variable as a linear gauge.
                 |ANNOT_LGND|    Legend representation of a variable palette that
                                 are only created by ``ENS_VAR`` objects.
                 |ANNOT_LINE|    Single line.
                 |ANNOT_LOGO|    Image annotation.
                 |ANNOT_SHAPE|   Generic 2D shapes, such as boxes, circles, and 2D arrows.
                 |ANNOT_TEXT|    Block of 2D overlay text.
                 =============== ===============================================

|GROUP|          ``GROUP`` objects play two roles. First, they provide a
                 hierarchical interface to collections of ``ENS_PART`` and ``ENS_LPART``
                 objects for display in the GUI or general organization. Second,
                 ``GROUP`` objects can be the output of a find operation, which can be handy
                 because they support fast, recursive, bulk property changes.
|LPART|          The ``LPART`` object represents an unloaded mesh object in a dataset.
                 These objects are created by ``ENS_CASE`` objects when a case loads a
                 dataset. The ``LPART`` object is used to create ``ENS_PART`` objects
                 from a dataset. In most cases, these objects are automatically leveraged
                 when a dataset is loaded.
|PALETTE|        ``PALETTE`` objects are allocated dynamically, but only indirectly under user
                 control. Every ``ENS_VARIABLE`` object has one or more ``ENS_PALETTE``
                 objects. For example, a ``ENS_VARIABLE`` object has one ``ENS_PALETTE`` object
                 for scalars and four ``ENS_PALETTE`` objects for vectors ([X],[Y],[Z],mag).
|PART|           A ``PART`` object represents a block of geometry in the current scene. The
                 geometry can come from the dataset on disk (via an ``LPART`` object), or it
                 can come from part *creation* methods. For example, a geometry can come
                 from creating such parts as iso-contours, clips, profiles, and vortex cores.
                 The PyEnSight API uses specific subclasses for each annotation
                 type. They all represent a mesh consisting of a collection of elements.
                 Usually these are located on the EnSight server, but in some cases they
                 are realized on the client.

                 ========================== ======================================================
                 Subclass                   Description
                 ========================== ======================================================
                 |PART_AUX_GEOM|            An auxiliary geometry part allows for scripted creation
                                            of objects like boxes that can be used in other
                                            calculations or to enhance visualizations. A backdrop
                                            is an example.
                 |PART_BUILT_UP|            This part is more commonly known as a *subset* part. It
                                            allows for collections of elements and nodes to be selected
                                            from a set of input parts. This collection is merged into
                                            this subset part.
                 |PART_CLIP|                This part is created by clipping a parent set of parts.
                 |PART_CONTOUR|             The part is a result of contouring a parent set of parts.
                 |PART_DEVELOPED_SURFACE|   A developed surface is generated by treating any
                                            2D part (or parent part) as a surface of revolution
                                            and mapping specific curvilinear coordinates of the
                                            revolved surface into a planar representation.
                 |PART_ELEVATED_SURFACE|    For a given collection of 2D parent parts, this
                                            part presents a displacement of the surface of the
                                            parents based on a specific variable and various
                                            parameters.
                 |PART_FILTER|              A filter part is created by applying a collection of
                                            variable range filters to a collection of parent parts.
                 |PART_FX_SEP_ATT|          Separation and attachment lines can be created on
                                            2D surfaces. These help visualize areas where flow
                                            abruptly leaves or returns to the 2D surface in 3D flow
                                            fields.
                 |PART_FX_SHOCK|            Shock region parts help visualize shock waves in a 3D
                                            flow field. Shock waves are characterized by an abrupt
                                            increase in density, energy, and pressure gradients,
                                            as well as a simultaneous sudden decrease in the
                                            velocity gradient.
                 |PART_FX_VORTEX_CORE|      Vortex cores help visualize the centers of swirling
                                            flow in a flow field. EnSight creates vortex core
                                            segments from the velocity gradient tensor of 3D flow
                                            field parts.
                 |PART_ISOSURFACE|          This part is created by applying isosurfacing to a parent
                                            set of parts.
                 |PART_MODEL|               This part is read from a dataset via an ``LPART`` object.
                 |PART_PARTICLE_TRACE|      Particle traces generated by integrating points
                                            through a vector field defined on a collection of
                                            parent parts.
                 |PART_POINT|               This part can be created via the API or from a file. It is
                                            a list of points. Commonly, the point tool is used to
                                            generate the list of points for the part.
                 |PART_PROFILE|             Profile parts are created by combining a 1D entity
                                            (such as a line clip, contour, or particle trace) with a
                                            surface part. The profile of a specific variable, sampled
                                            over the 1D entity, is captured in a profile part.
                 |PART_TENSOR_GLYPH|        A part representing a tensor field on a collection of
                                            parts as a collection of orientated and colored glyphs.
                 |PART_VECTOR_ARROW|        A part representing a vector field on a collection of
                                            parts as a collection of orientated and colored arrows.

|PLOTTER|        A ``PLOTTER`` object is a visual frame for displaying one or more ``ENS_QUERY``
                 objects. It includes axes, titles, backgrounds, borders, and legends.
|POLYLINE|       In EnSight, ``POLYLINE`` objects are called splines. They can be used to set up
                 things like camera paths.
|QUERY|          A ``QUERY`` object represents ``y = f(x)`` data. This data can come directly from a
                 dataset, created when the ``ENS_CASE`` object loads a dataset. Or, queries can be
                 created using loaded or computed data. For example, you could query the values of
                 pressure along a line segment through a ``PART`` object of volumetric elements.
|VAR|            A ``VAR`` object represents a specific field variable, case, or part constant.
                 The base object contains the metadata associated with the variable, such as
                 ranges. Variables can be introduced directly from datasets, but they
                 can also be created using calculator functions.
