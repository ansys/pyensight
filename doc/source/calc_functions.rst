Calculator functions
====================

EnSight supports a large number of calculator functions.
An :class:`ENS_VAR<ansys.api.pyensight.ens_var.ENS_VAR>` object can represent
either fields read from disk or the use of a calculator function
to compute a new variable from an input collection of parts, variables, and
user-specified parameters.

You can use the native API function :func:`pyensight.ensight_api.variables.evaluate`
and the object API function :func:`pyensight.ens_globals.ENS_GLOBALS.create_variable`
to create new EnSight variables that leverage these calculator functions.
These function use a string representation of the function to create the
new variable. Most calculator functions take a partlist (``plist``) as
a parameter. In the native API, you use the ``plist`` string to refer to the currently
selected parts. In the object API, you use the same ``plist`` text string, but you
can specify the selection of parts to be used directly via the ``source`` keyword.

This code provides some examples::

    # Create a variable named 'newvar1' using the :ref:`CmplxTransResp <CmplxTransResp>`
    # calculator function and the input variable 'c_scalar'. The variable is to be defined on
    # all of the current parts.
    session.ensight.part.select_all()
    session.ensight.variables.evaluate("newvar1 = CmplxTransResp(plist,c_scalar,90.0)")
    # Create a variable named 'newvar2' using the :ref:`EleSize <EleSize>`
    # calculator function. The variable is to be defined on all of the current parts.
    varobj = session.ensight.objs.core.create_variable("newvar2", "EleSize(plist)",
                                                       sources=session.ensight.objs.core.PARTS)


.. admonition::  Per-part constants

    Some calculator functions (such as :ref:`Area() <Area>`) return constant values. EnSight
    supports constant values that are per-case and per-part. For example, if  the :ref:`Area() <Area>`
    function is computed as a per-case constant, the value is the sum of the area values computed
    part by part. If the :ref:`Area() <Area>` function is computed as a per-part constant, the individual
    values for each part are stored on each part.

    All constant values are computed as per-case by default. For per-part computation, you
    must add an optional additional argument to the function. For example, ``Area(plist)``
    results in a per-case constant by default. ``Area(plist,Compute_Per_case)`` is also computed
    as per-case explicitly. ``Area(plist,Compute_Per_part)`` results in the variable being
    computed as per-part.

    Not all calculator functions support this. For those that do, the notion ``[,Compute_Per_part]``
    appears in the documentation. For an example, see: :ref:`Area() <Area>`.


.. _Area:

Area()
------

**Area**

``Area(any part or parts [, Compute_Per_part])``

Computes a constant or constant per part variable whose
value is the area of the selected parts. If a part is composed of 3D elements,
the area is of the border representation of the part. The area of 1D elements is
zero.

BL_aGradOfVelMag()

**Boundary Layer: A Gradient of Velocity Magnitude**

``BL_aGradOfVelMag(boundary part or parts, velocity)``

Computes a vector variable that is the gradient of the
magnitude of the specified velocity variable on the selected boundary part
or parts. The vector variable is defined as:

:math:`GRA{D}_{BP}\left|V\right|={\nabla }_{BP}\left|V\right|=\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\widehat{i}+\frac{\partial V}{\partial y}\widehat{j}+\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}\widehat{k}`

      - magnitude of velocity vector = :math:`\sqrt{VÂ·V}`
    * - x, y, z
      - coordinate directions
    * - i, j, k
      - unit vectors in coordinate directions


.. note::
    For each boundary part, this function finds its corresponding field part
    (``pfield``), computes the gradient of the velocity
    magnitude on the field part (``Grad(pfield,velocity``), and
    then maps these computed values onto the boundary part.

    Node or element IDs are used if they exist. Otherwise, the coordinate
    values between the field part and boundary part are mapped and resolved via
    a floating-point hashing scheme.

    This velocity-magnitude gradient variable can be used as an argument for
    the following boundary-layer functions that require this variable.

    Boundary layer (``BL_*``) functions are not supported for
    Server of Server (SoS) decomposition.

This scalar variable provides a measure of the skin-friction coefficient in the
tangent (parallel-to-surface) direction and in its tangent's respective
stream-wise and cross-flow directions, respective to the decomposed velocity
parallel to the surface at the edge of the boundary layer.

This is a non-dimensional measure of the fluid shear
stress at the surface based on the local density and velocity at the edge of the
boundary layer. The following figure illustrates the derivations of the computed
*edge*-related velocity values: :math:`{U}_{e}`, :math:`{u}_{s}`, :math:`{u}_{c}`,
and :math:`{c}_{}`.

This is a non-dimensional measure of the fluid shear
stress at the surface. An important aspect of the skin friction coefficient
is that :math:`{C}_{f\left(\infty \right)}=0`, which indicates boundary layer separation.

**Boundary Layer: Shape Parameter**

``BL_Shape()`` is not explicitly listed as a general function, but it can
be computed as a scalar variable via the calculator by
dividing a displacement thickness by a momentum thickness:

:math:`H=\frac{{\delta }^{*}}{\theta }`

      - boundary-layer momentum thickness


This scalar variable is used to characterize boundary-layer flows, especially to
indicate potential for separation. This variable increases as a
separation point is approached, and it varies rapidly near a separation
point.

.. note::
    Separation has not been observed for H < 1.8, but it definitely
    has been observed for H = 2.6. Thus, separation is considered
    in some analytical methods to occur in turbulent boundary layers for H = 2.0.

    In a Blasius Laminar layer (that is flat plate boundary
    layer growth with zero pressure gradient), H = 2.605. In a turbulent boundary layer,
    H ~= 1.4 to 1.5, and with extreme variations, H ~= 1.2 to 2.5.

.. admonition::  Algorithm: Boundary Layer Thickness

    The ``ymax`` argument allows the edge of the boundary layer to be approximated by two
    different algorithms: the Baldwin-Lomax-Spalart algorithm and the convergence algorithm.
    Both algorithms profile velocity data normal to the boundary surface (wall).
    Specifying ``ymax > 0`` leverages results from both the Baldwin-Lomax and vorticity
    functions over the entire profile to produce a fading function that approximates the edge
    of the boundary layer, whereas specifying ``ymax = 0`` uses velocity and
    velocity gradient differences to converge to the edge of the boundary
    layer.

**Case Map**

``CaseMap(2D or 3D parts, case to map from, scalar/vector/tensor, parts to map from, search option flag)``


For all locations on the selected parts, this function
finds the specified variable value (scalar, vector, or tensor) from
the *case to map from* using a variety of user-specified
search options.

- If the variable in the *case to map from* is located at the nodes, the
  case-mapped variable is defined on the nodes of the selected parts.
- If the variable is located at the elements, the case-mapped variable is
  defined at the elements of the selected parts.

The idea is to map onto the selected parts a variable from another case,
usually for comparison purposes. It does this by taking the
location of the nodes or centroid of the elements and looking at the other case
to see if the variable in question is defined at that location in the field. If
so, the value is mapped to the parts nodes or element value. This algorithm can
be fairly expensive, so there are options to inform the search that finds a
matching variable location.

.. list-table:: **Function arguments**
    :widths:  30 70

    * - case to map from
      - constant number
    * - scalar/vector/tensor
      - scalar, vector, or tensor variable
    * - search option
      - If mapping search is successful, always
        assigns the exact value found. If search mapping is not successful, because
        there is not an exact match of node or element location, the
        following occurs:

        If the search option is set to *search only* (0), an undefined value
        is assigned.

        If the search option is set to *nearest value* (1), the defined variable
        value at the closest node or element is assigned (no undefined values).
        This option takes time to search the *from case* according to
        the following *parts to map from* selection.

    * - parts to map from
      - The values for a location must be found by
        searching the geometry in the *case to map from*. By setting this
        option, you can hint to EnSight where in the geometry it should
        search, which can vastly improve performance.

        *Global search* (0) - This is the legacy scheme. It
        performs a methodical but uninformed search of the 3D,
        then 2D, then 1D, and then even 0D (point) elements to find the first
        defined variable value. This works well for mapping onto a 3D or 2D
        that is completely enclosed in a 3D *from* volume. It works poorly
        if the 2D is not fully enclosed (such as on
        the edge of a 3D part) or if you want to map a 2D onto a 2D part and
        other 3D parts exist.

        *Dimensionality match* (1) - Only parts of the same
        dimension in the from and to are searched. For example, only 3D
        *from* parts are used to map onto a 3D
        selected part. This is the option that the you should use most
        often.

        *Part number match* (2) - The order of the parts is
        used, that is if you are computing the case map on the third part,
        then the third part is used in the *case to map from*. This is best
        used if you have exactly the same dataset in terms of the part list
        ordering, but perhaps calculated differently so only the variable
        values differ.

        *Parts selected for case to map from* (3) - Select
        parts in the Case *from* as well as the case *to*. Only selected parts
        are used in the two cases.


.. note::
    This function uses EnSight's search capability to do the mapping. It is
    critical that the nodes of the parts being mapped onto lie within the
    geometry of all of the parts of the case being mapped from. Mapping from a
    2D surface to a 2D surface only works reliably if the surfaces are the
    same (or extremely close, and the ``flag=1`` option is chosen).

    Mapping nodal variables is faster than mapping elemental variables. This function is
    threaded so an Enterprise (formerly Gold or HPS) license key may improve
    performance.

    Select only the parts that you require, and use search option ``0`` if at all possible.

without removing previously assigned values.

.. _Defect_Functions:

---------------------------------------------
Porosity characterization functions (defects)
---------------------------------------------

Consider a mesh with a scalar per element variable representing the micro porosity of each
cell, where ``0`` means no porosity (the cell is completely full) and ``100`` means that the cell is
fully porous (the cell is empty). Cells with a non-zero porosity are considered to have
defects. Defects that span multiple cells may indicate an unacceptable defect.

Six ``Defect_*`` functions are provided to help calculate factors of interest in characterizing
the defects that occur over multiple cells. To use the following ``Defect_*`` functions, you would
create an isovolume of your porosity variable between the desired ranges (perhaps 5 to 100) and
select this isovolume part.

Returns a case constant that filters the count of the
number of defects existing between the minimum value and the maximum value. This
function uses a ``defect scalar per elem`` variable that has been previously calculated by any of
the other five :ref:`Defect functions <Defect_Functions>`.

``Defect_LargestLinearExtent(2D or 3D parts)``


Returns a per element scalar that is the largest linear
extent of all the cells comprising the defect, where each cell of the defect is
assigned this value. The largest linear extent is the root-mean-squared
distance.

For input specifications, see :ref:`Defect Functions <Defect_Functions>`.


.. _Defect_NetVolume:

------------------
Defect_NetVolume()
------------------

**Defect NetVolume**

``Defect_NetVolume(2D or 3D parts, scalar per elem, scale factor)``


Returns a per element scalar that is the sum of the cell
volumes multiplied by the scalar per element variable multiplied by the scale
factor of all the cells comprising the defect, where each cell of the defect is
assigned this value. The ``scalar per elem`` variable is usually porosity,
but you can use any per element scalar variable. The scale factor
adjusts the scalar per element variable values, that is if the porosity range is
from 0.0 to 100.0, then a scale factor of 0.01 can be used to normalize the
porosity values to volume fraction values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

.. _Dist2Nodes:

Dist2Nodes()
------------


**Distance Between Nodes**

``Dist2Nodes(any parts, nodeID1, nodeID2)``


Computes a constant, positive variable that is the distance between any two nodes.
This function searches down the part list until it finds *nodeID1* and
then searches until it finds *nodeID2*. It returns ``Undefined`` if *nodeID1* or *nodeID2*
cannot be found. Nodes are designated by their node IDs, so the part must have node IDs.

.. note::
    Most created parts do not have node IDs.

    The geometry type is important for using this function. There are three geometry types:
    static, changing coordinate, and changing connectivity. You can find out your geometry
    type by selecting **QueryâDataset** and looking in the **General Geometric section** of the
    popup window.

    If you have a static geometry with visual displacement turned on, the ``Dis2Nodes``
    function does not use the displacement in its calculations. You must enable server-side
    (computational) displacement. If you have changing coordinate geometry, the ``Dist2Nnodes``
    function works without adjustment. If you have changing connectivity, the ``Dist2nNodes``
    function should not be used as it can give nonsensical results because connectivity is
    reevaluated each timestep and node IDs may be reassigned.

    For transient results, to find the distance between two nodes on different parts, or
    between two nodes if one or both nodes don't have IDs or the IDs are not unique for the model
    (namely, more than one part has the same node ID), use the line tool.

.. _Dist2Part:

Dist2Part()
-----------


**Distance to Parts: Node to Nodes**

``Dist2Part(origin part + field parts, origin part, origin part normal)``


Computes a scalar variable on the origin part and field
parts that is the minimum distance at each node of the origin and field parts to
any node in the origin part. This distance is unsigned by default. The origin
part is the origin of a Euclidean distance field. So, by definition, the scalar
variable is always zero at the origin part because the distance to the
origin part is always zero.

The origin part normal vector must be a per node
variable. If the origin part normal is calculated using the ``Normal`` calculator
function, it is a per element variable and must be moved to the nodes using
the calculator.

.. note::
    The origin part must be included in the field part list (although, as
    mentioned earlier, the scalar variable is zero for all nodes on the
    origin part). This algorithm has an execution time on the order of the
    number of nodes in the field parts times the number of nodes in the origin
    part. While the implementation is both SOS-aware and threaded, the run time
    is dominated by the number of nodes in the computation.


This function is computed between the nodes of the
origin and field parts. As a result, the accuracy of its approximation to the
distance field is limited to the density of nodes (effectively the size of the
elements) in the origin part. If a more accurate approximation is required, use
the :ref:`Dist2PartElem() <Dist2PartElem>` function. While this function is slower,
it is less dependent on the nodal distribution in the origin part because it uses the
nodes plus the element faces to calculate the minimum distance.

**Usage**

You typically use an arbitrary 2D part to create a clip in a 3D field. You
then use the 2D part as your origin part and select the origin part as well
as your 3D field parts. There is no need to have normal vectors. After creating your
scalar variable, which you might call ``distTo2Dpart``, you create
an ``isosurface=0`` in your field using ``distTo2Dpart`` as your variable.

.. _Dist2PartElem:

---------------
Dist2PartElem()
---------------


**Distance to Parts: Node to Elements**

``Dist2PartElem(origin part + field parts, origin part, origin part normal)``


Computes a scalar variable that is the minimum distance
at each node of the origin part and field parts and the closest point on any
element in the origin part.

- If the origin part normal vector is not supplied, this distance is unsigned.
- If the origin part normal vector is supplied, the distance is signed.

.. note::
    The origin part normal vector must be a per node variable. If the origin part
    normal is calculated using the :ref:`Normal() <Normal>` function,
    it is a per element variable and must be moved to the nodes using the
    :ref:`ElemToNode() <ElemToNode>` function. If it is per node and
    the origin part normal vector variable defined at the origin part is supplied,
    the direction of the normal is used to return a signed distance function
    with distances in the direction of the normal being positive.


Once the closest point in the origin part has been found
for a node in an field part, the dot product of the origin node normal and a
vector between the two nodes is used to select the sign of the result.

.. note::
    The origin part must be included in the field part list (although the
    output is zero for all nodes of the origin part because it is the
    origin of the Euclidean distance). This algorithm has an execution time on
    the order of the number of nodes in the field parts multiplied by the number of
    elements in the origin part. While the implementation is both SOS-aware and
    threaded, the run time is dominated by the number of nodes in the
    computation.


This function is a more accurate estimation of the distance field than the :ref:`Dist2Part() <Dist2Part>`
function because it allows for distances between nodes and element surfaces on the origin part. This
improved accuracy results in increased computational complexity. As a result, the ``Dist2PartElem`` function
can be several times slower than the :ref:`Dist2Part() <Dist2Part>` function.

.. _EleSize:

---------
EleSize()
---------


**Element Size**

``EleSize(any parts).``

Calculates the Volume/Area/Length for 3D/2D/1D elements
respectively, at each element creating a scalar, element-based variable.

.. note::
    This function uses the coordinates of the element to calculate the volume of each
    element. If you want to use displacement in the calculation of the volume, you must
    turn on computational (server-side) displacement, rather than visual only
    (client side) displacement. When computation displacement is turned on, displacement
    values are applied to the coordinates on the server prior to calculating the element
    size.

    If you calculate the element size of a part and then use that part to create a
    child part, the child part inherits the values of the ``EleSize`` calculation, which
    are the size of the parent elements and not the size of the child elements. If you want the
    ``EleSize`` of the child part, then you must select the child part and recalculate a new
    variable.



.. _ElemToNode:

------------
ElemToNode()

**Element to Node**

``ElemToNode(any parts, element-based scalar or vector).``

node-based variable.

For each **node[i]** â :math:`\text{valÂ +=Â (elem[j]->valÂ *Â elem[j]->wt)Â |Â node[i]}`

For each **node[i]** â :math:`\text{wtÂ +=Â elem[j]->wtÂ |Â node[i]}`

Results: **node[i]** â :math:`\text{valÂ /=Â node[i]->wt}`

.. list-table::
    :widths:  30 70

    * - wt
      - 1 for this algorithm and the weighting scalar in the :ref:`ElemToNodeWeighted() <ElemToNodeWeighted>` method

      - iterator on all part nodes (nodes[i] must be on elem[j] to contribute)
    * - | node[i]
      - indicates node that is associated with elem[j]


By default, this function uses all
parts that share each node of the one or more selected parts. Parts that are not
selected, whose elements are shared by nodes of the selected parts, have
their element values averaged in with those of the selected parts.



.. _ElemToNodeWeighted:

--------------------
ElemToNodeWeighted()
--------------------


**Element to Node Weighted**

``ElemToNodeWeighted(any parts, element-based scalar or vector, element-based weighting scalar).``


This function is the same as the :ref:`ElemToNode() <ElemToNode>` function, except
that the value of the variable at the element is weighted by an element scalar.
That is, elem[j] â wt is the value of the weighting scalar in the :ref:`ElemToNode() <ElemToNode>`
function previously described.

One use of this function might be to use the element
size as a weighting factor so that larger elements contribute more to the nodal
value than smaller oelements.

    If the variable is at the element, it is moved to the nodes. Each element
    is then mapped to a normalized element and the Jacobian is calculated
    for the transformation from the element to the normalized element.
    Next, the inverse Jacobian is calculated for this transformation and used to
    compute the Jacobian for the scalar variable. Therefore, the chain rule is used
    with the inverse Jacobian of the transformation and the Jacobian of the scalar
    variable to calculate the gradient for each node of each element. The
    contributions of the gradient from all the elements are moved to all the nodes
    using an unweighted average. Finally, if the original variable is per element,
    the gradient is moved from the nodes to the elements using an unweighted
    average.

Computes a scalar variable that is the second eigenvalue (or :math:`{\lambda }_{2}`) of the second
invariant (or Q-criterion) of the velocity gradient tensor. Vortex shells can
then be visualized as an iso-surface of :math:`{\lambda }_{2}` = 0. Here is how inputs

First calculate the three components of velocity:

Vel_x = Velocity[X] = x-component of the velocity vector

Vel_y = Velocity[Y] = y-component of the velocity vector

Vel_z = Velocity[Z] = z-component of the velocity vector

Then calculate the gradients using the intermediate variable:

Grad_Vel_x = Grad(any parts, Vel_x) = gradient of x component Velocity

Grad_Vel_y = Grad(any parts, Vel_y) = gradient of y component Velocity

Grad_Vel_z = Grad(any parts, Vel_z) = gradient of z component Velocity

where:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 50 50

    * - Velocity

.. note::
    A common mistake is to try to calculate the gradient from the component of
    the velocity without using the intermediate ``Vel_x``, ``Vel_y``, and ``Vel_z``
    variables. For example, the following calculation is wrong. It uses only the velocity magnitude.

    Grad_Vel_x = Grad(any parts, Velocity[X])

    This is a *User-Defined Math Function (UDMF)*, which you may modify and
    recompile. For more information, see the *EnSight Interface Manual*.


.. admonition::  Algorithm: Lambda2

    Combine to compute the symmetric tensor:

    Compute and sort the eigenvalues of :math:`Q`  (using Jacobi eigen analysis). Then,
    assign the second eigenvalue, or :math:`{\lambda }_{2}`, as the scalar value at the node:

.. _OffsetField:

OffsetField()

**Normalize Vector**

``OffsetField(2D or 3D parts)``


Computes a scalar field of offset values. The values
are in model distance units perpendicular to the boundary of the part.

.. note::
    An isosurface created in this field would mimic the part boundary, but at the offset
    distance into the field.

    This function is not supported for Server of Server (SOS)
    decomposition because SOS was designed to benefit from independent
    server computations in parallel. The interdependent computational
    mapping of the field results from the fluid part onto the boundary part
    violates this assumption. In other words, because you cannot be sure that you
    have all of the fluid information on one server for the mapping, this
    function is disabled.



.. _OffsetVar:

-----------
OffsetVar()
-----------


**Offset Variable**

``OffsetVar(2D or 3D parts, scalar or vector, constant offset value)``


Computes a scalar (or vector) variable defined as the
offset value into the field of that variable that exists in the normal direction
from the boundary of the selected part. This assigns near surface values of a
variable to the surface of the selected parts from the neighboring 3D field,
which is found automatically using the selected parts surfaces.

In other words, this function gets the value of a
variable from surrounding fields, a fixed distance from the surface of the
selected parts, and assigns it to the surface of the selected part. For
example, you might use this function to get the value of the velocity in the
flow field a slight distance above your vehicle surface and assign that value to
your vehicle surface.

To use this function, select the parts in the part list
that you want to use and enter both a variable and an offset. EnSight automatically
detects the 3D field parts adjacent to the surfaces of your selected parts and reaches
into these fields by your offset in the normal direction to obtain the variable value
and then assign it to the surface of your selected parts.

.. list-table:: **Function arguments**

    * - constant offset value
      - constant number (constant variable is not valid)

.. note::
    Choose a negative offset if your normals do not point into the field.

    This function is not supported for Server of Server (SOS)
    decomposition because SOS was designed to benefit from independent server
    computations in parallel. Recall that EnSight must find the field adjacent
    to the surfaces of your selected parts. Because some of these fields might be
    on other servers, creating dependencies that preclude independent
    servers, this function is disabled.

the value is the maximum part number.


.. note::
    Any client-side part (for example, a vector arrow, particle trace, or profile)
    is assigned the ``Undefined`` value. Model parts are always server-side parts.

**Total Pressure**

``PresT(any parts, pressure, velocity, density)``


Computes a scalar variable whose value is the total
pressure :math:`{p}_{t}`. This scalar variable is defined as:

:math:`{p}_{t}=p+\rho \frac{{V}^{2}}{2}`

where:

.. note::
    In literature, total pressure is used interchangeably with stagnation
    pressure. The total pressure (or stagnation pressure) use two different
    equations, depending upon the flow regime: incompressible or compressible.
    EnSight has chosen to define total pressure using the preceding incompressible flow
    equation and stagnation pressure using the compressible flow
    equation. See :ref:`PreStag() <PresStag>`.

Q_criteria()

**Q_criteria**

``Q_criteria(any parts, Grad_Vel_x, Grad_Vel_y, Grad_Vel_z)``


Computes a scalar variable that is the second
invariant, or Q-criterion, of the velocity gradient tensor. Vortex shells may
then be visualized as an iso-surface of Q-criterion > 0. Here is how inputs
to this function are calculated:

First calculate the three components of velocity:

Vel_x = Velocity[X] = x-component of the velocity vector

Vel_y = Velocity[Y] = y-component of the velocity vector

Vel_z = Velocity[Z] = z-component of the velocity vector

Then calculate the gradients using the intermediate variable:

Grad_Vel_x = Grad(any parts, Vel_x) = gradient of x component Velocity

Grad_Vel_y = Grad(any parts, Vel_y) = gradient of y component Velocity

Grad_Vel_z = Grad(any parts, Vel_z) = gradient of z component Velocity

with:

Velocity = velocity vector variable

.. note::
    A common mistake is to try to calculate the gradient
    from the component of the velocity without using the intermediate ``Vel_x``,
    ``Vel_y``, and ``Vel_z`` variables. For example, the following calculation is wrong.
    It uses only the velocity magnitude.

    Grad_Vel_x = Grad(any parts, Velocity[X])

    This is a *User-Defined Math Function (UDMF)*, which you may modify and
    recompile. For more information, see the *EnSight Interface Manual*.


.. admonition::  Algorithm: Q_criteria

    The three gradient vectors of the components of the
    velocity vector constitute the velocity gradient tensor. Using the nine components
    of this (antisymmetric) velocity gradient tensor, ``Lv``, construct both the
    symmetric, :math:`S` , and antisymmetric, :math:`\Omega`, parts of the
    velocity gradient tensor, the :math:`Q` criteria is established as follows.

    :math:`\nabla \nu =S+\Omega`

    where

    :math:`S=\frac{1}{2}\left[\nabla \nu +{\left(\nabla \nu \right)}^{T}\right]`


    :math:`\Omega =\frac{1}{2}\left[\nabla \nu -{\left(\nabla \nu \right)}^{T}\right]`

    solving for :math:`Q`  (hence :math:`Q`  criteria) when

    :math:`Q=\frac{1}{2}\left[{\left|\Omega \right|}^{2}-{\left|S\right|}^{2}\right]`

    which (in terms of EnSight variables) reduces to:

    .. code-block::

       Q = - 0.5 * ( Grad_Vel_x[X] * Grad_vel_x[X] + Grad_Vel_y[Y] * Grad_vel_y[Y] + Grad_Vel_z[Z] * Grad_Vel_z[Z] +
             2 * (Grad_Vel_x[Y] * Grad_Vel_y[X] + Grad_Vel_x[Z] * Grad_Vel_z[X] + Grad_Vel_y[Z] * Grad_Vel_z[Y])) > 0


    Now, to find the vortices, create an isosurface where Q
    is positive (Q > 0). This is because an isosurface with positive Q isolates
    areas where the strength of the rotation overcomes the strain, thus making those
    surfaces eligible as vortex envelopes.

    See also the :ref:`Lambda2() <Lambda2>` function.

**Radiograph_grid**

``Radiograph_grid(1D or 2D parts, dir X, dir Y, dir Z, num_points, variable, [component])``


Computes a per element scalar variable on the designated
1D or 2D parts, that is a directional integration from these parts of a scalar
variable or vector component through the model.

Think of rays being cast from the center of each element of the 1D or 2D parents
in the direction specified (and long enough to extend through the model). Along
each ray, the desired variable is integrated and the integral value is assigned
to the element from which the ray was cast. This function integrates the ray in
a constant delta, grid-like fashion. You control the delta by the number of points that is
specified in the integration direction.

.. note::
   While this function is not generally as time-consuming as the
   :ref:`Radiograph_mesh() <Radiograph_mesh>` function (and you have
   some resolution control with the ``num_points`` argument), it
   can still take some computation time. You might want to set the Abort server

.. _SmoothMesh:

------------
SmoothMesh()
------------


**Mesh Smoothing**

``SmoothMesh(any 1D or 2D parts, number of passes, weight)``


Performs a mesh "smoothing" operation. This function
returns a vector variable which, when applied to the mesh as a displacement,
results in a "smoother" mesh representation. The function computes new node
locations resulting from a "normalization" of the mesh elements.

The result of this function tends to be a mesh with equal-sized elements.
The algorithm applies a form of convolution to the mesh edges repeatedly
(number of passes) using a weighting factor to control how much change
in position is allowed in each pass. In most cases, the weight is supplied
as a constant, but the weight can be specified as a nodal scalar array.
This allows for local control over the region of the mesh to be smoothed.
The algorithm is fully threaded.


.. note::
    Nodes on the outer boundary of a mesh (or are bounded by ghost elements) are not
    allowed to move. A good set of initial parameters might be 50 passes with a
    weight constant of 0.05.


For each pass, the following formula is applied:

:math:`{x}_{i+1}={x}_{i}+w{\displaystyle \sum _{j=0}^{n}\left({x}_{j}-{x}_{i}\right)}`

where

:math:`x`  = nodal position at pass (i)

:math:`w`  = nodal weight

:math:`n`  = edge connected nodes

.. _SOSConstant:

-------------
SOSConstant()

**SOS Constant**

``SOSConstant(any parts, variable, reduction operation (0-3))``


.. note::
    Generally this function should not be necessary. The :ref:`SOSConstant() <SOSConstant>`
    function has been pulled into the server/SOS infrastructure. However, this function
    remains for backward compatibility.

Computes a constant variable whose value is the result of applying a reduction operation
on that constant variable over the values on each of the servers. If there is no SOS involved
or only a single server, the result is the same as the constant variable value on the single
server.

The selected part is used to select the case from which the constant variable is
used. The constant variable itself is specified (from the dataset or a computed
value). The operation to perform is selected as an integer from ``0`` to ``3``:

- ``0``: A simple summation of the values from each of the servers.
- ``1``: An average of the values from the servers. (The weight given to each server
  in the average is the same, so this is essentially the sum operation divided by the number of servers.)
- ``2``: The minimum of the values on each of the servers.
- ``3``: The maximum of the values on each of the servers.

    :widths: 30 70

.. _SpaMean:

---------
SpaMean()
---------


**Spatial Mean**

``SpaMean(any parts, scalar or (vector, component) [,Compute_Per_part])``


Computes a constant or constant per part variable whose
value is the volume (or area or length) weighted mean value of a scalar (or
vector component) at the current time. This value can change with time. The
component is not requested if a scalar variable is used.

The spatial mean is computed by summing the product of
the volume (3D, area 2D, or length 1D) of each element by the value of the
scalar (or vector component) taken at the centroid of the element (nodal
variables are interpolated at each cell centroid using cell shape blending or
metric functions) for each element over the entire part. The final sum is then
divided by the total volume (or area) of the part.

:math:`\text{SpatialÂ Mean}=\frac{{\displaystyle \sum {s}_{i}vo{l}_{i}}}{{\displaystyle \sum vo{l}_{i}}}`

where:

:math:`{s}_{i}`  = scalar taken at centroid of element i

-----------------
SpaMeanWeighted()
-----------------


**Spatial Mean Weighted**

``SpaMeanWeighted(any parts, scalar or (vector, component), weight, component [,Compute_Per_part])``


Computes a constant or constant per part variable whose value is
weighted both by the volume (or area or length) and a weighting variable.
This value can change with time. For both the variable
itself and the weighting variable, the component is not requested if a scalar
variable is used.

The weighted spatial mean is computed by summing the
product of the volume (3D, area 2D, or length if 1D) of each element by the
value of the scalar (or vector component) taken at the centroid of the element
(nodal variables are interpolated at each cell centroid using cell shape
blending or metric functions) with the product of the weighting scalar/vector
component taken at the centroid of the element (again, if a nodal variable,
similarly evaluated at the element centroid) for each element over the entire
part. The final sum is then divided by the total scalar/vector weighted (again
if a nodal weighting variable is similarly evaluated at the element centroid)
volume (or area or length) of the part as follows:

:math:`\text{SpatialÂ MeanÂ Weighted}=\frac{{\displaystyle \sum {w}_{i}{s}_{i}vo{l}_{i}}}{{\displaystyle \sum {w}_{i}vo{l}_{i}}}`

where:

:math:`{s}_{i}`  = scalar or vector component taken at centroid of element i

:math:`{w}_{i}`  = scalar or vector component taken at centroid of element i

:math:`vo{l}_{i}`  = volume (or area or length) of element i

where:

:math:`u,v,w`  = velocity components in the :math:`x,y,z`  directions.

where:

:math:`\gamma`  = ratio of specific heats

.. _StatMoment:

------------
StatMoment()

**Statistics Moments**

``StatMoment(any parts, v, function [,Compute_Per_part])``


Computes a constant or constant per part that is the
sum, mean, variance, skew, or kurtosis by applying a selected statistical
function over all of the nodes or elements of the selected parts, given the
selected scalar or constant variable. Five functions are defined:

:math:`sum={\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{N}{\nu }_{i}}`


:math:`mean=\frac{1}{N}{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{N}{\nu }_{i}}`


:math:`\mathrm{var}=\frac{1}{N-1}{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{N}{\left({\nu }_{i}-mean\right)}^{2}}`


:math:`skew=\frac{1}{N}{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{N}{\left(\frac{{\nu }_{i}-mean}{\sqrt{\mathrm{var}}}\right)}^{3}}`


:math:`kurt=\left\{\frac{1}{N}{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{N}{\left(\frac{{\nu }_{i}-mean}{\sqrt{\mathrm{var}}}\right)}^{4}}\right\}-3`

- The ``mean`` is the simple average (unweighted, arithmetic mean) of all the
  samples.
- The ``var`` is the variance, which is an indication of the spread of a
  sample of numbers out from the mean. It is the square of the standard
  deviation.
- The ``skew`` is an indication of the degree of asymmetry about the mean. A
  positive skew indicates an asymmetric tail toward more positive values.
  A negative skew indicates an asymmetric tail toward more negative values.
- The ``kurt`` is the kurtosis, which is an indication of the peakness or
  flatness of the distribution compared to a normal distribution. A positive
  kurtosis indicates more peakness. A negative kurtosis indicates a more flat
  distribution.

If the variable (``v``) is a constant, the operation is computed as if the
variable was a nodal variable with the given value at all nodes. If the
computation is over an element variable, the size of the element is not
used in the computation. If volume or area weighting is desired, the
variable must be pre-weighted.

.. note::

    ``StatMoment(plist,scalar,0)`` should be used in place of the
    example user-defined math function, ``udmf_sum``, because the
    :ref:`StatMoment() <StatMoment>` function is threaded and
    properly handles ghost cells. However, for parallel (SOS) computation,
    because nodes at the interface are shared among servers, the values at
    the interface nodes are used in computations multiple times. Therefore,
    the``StatMoment`` value computed using a nodal variable using SOS deviates
    from the true value calculated using only one server. Elemental variables
    do not suffer from this issue as ghost elements are handled properly and
    elements are not shared among servers.

------------
StatRegSpa()
------------


**Statistics Regression**

``StatRegSpa(any parts, y, x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, weight)``


Performs classical multivariate linear regression,
predicting ``y = f(x0,x1,x2,x3,x4)``. The regression is performed at the current
timestep using all of the nodes/elements of the selected parts. At each
node/element, the input values y, x0, x1, x2, x3, and x4 and the weight are evaluated
and added as an observation to the regression with the supplied weight (in the
range [0.0-1.0]). If the model does not require five inputs, any of them can be
specified as the constant number ``0.0`` to remove it. If the constant ``1.0`` is
supplied as an input, an intercept is computed. You should avoid
co-linearity in the inputs (which is especially easy when supplying constants as
regressors).

For example, to model simple linearity (``y = Ax0 + B``), the function
parameters would be ``StatRegSpa(plist, yvar, xvar, 1., 0., 0., 0., 1.)``. This
example specifies that all observations are to be weighted the same.
If weighting by element volume is desired, compute a field variable of
element volume, normalized by the largest individual element volume, and pass
that variable as the weight. The function returns a scalar constant whose value
is the R-squared value for the regression.

:math:`{\Gamma }_{k}\left(P\right)=\frac{1}{S}{\displaystyle \int \mathrm{sin}\left({\Theta }_{M}\right)dS}=\frac{1}{S}{\displaystyle \underset{\left(M\in S\right)}{\int }\left(\frac{\left(\stackrel{\rightharpoonup }{PM}\times {\stackrel{\rightharpoonup }{V}}_{M}\right)Â·\widehat{n}}{\Vert \stackrel{\rightharpoonup }{PM}\Vert Â·\Vert {\stackrel{\rightharpoonup }{V}}_{M}\Vert }\right)dS}`

    * - :math:`{\Gamma }_{1}`
      - Gamma function number k=1 is a (non-Galilean invariant)
        vortex center approximation method "...a dimensionless scalar,
        with G1 bounded by 1. It can be shown that this bound is
        reached at the location of the vortex centre if the vortex is
        axis symmetrical. Therefore, this scalar function provides a way
        to quantify the streamline topology of the flow in the vicinity
        of P and the rotation sign of the vortex. ... Typically, near
        the vortex centre, G1 reaches values ranging from 0.9 to 1.0."
        [ref.2, pp. 1424-1425].

    * - :math:`{\Gamma }_{2}`
      - Gamma function number k=2 is a (Galilean invariant) vortex
        boundary approximation method resulting in a dimensionless
        scalar, "... a local function depending only on W and Î¼,
        where W is the rotation rate corresponding to the antisymmetrical
        part of the velocity gradient at P and Î¼ is the eigenvalue of the
        symmetrical part of this tensor [ref.2, 1425]. (See the
        note following the function arguments.)

    * - k
      - Gamma function number 1 or 2 used to determine VM.

    * - P
      - Base node (or element centroid for per-element data) around
        which the proximity area (or zone of influence) is being
        considered.

    * - S
      - Proximity area (or zone of influence) surrounding P,
        determined by a proximity radius measured from the base P and
        the proximity option. The proximity option is used to determine
        which set of elements to include in S as follows.

        If the proximity option is 0, S includes all elements
        with any nodes within the proximity radius.

        If the proximity option is 1, S includes only elements with
        every node within the proximity radius. Both options also
        include all elements that contain P.

    * - M
      - Node (or element center) within S.

    * - PM
      - Vector from the base node P to M.

    * - V(P)
      - Velocity vector at P.

    * - V(M)
      - Velocity vector at each M.

    * - :math:`V_M`

      - If the gamma function number k = 1, VM = V(M). If the gamma function
        number k = 2, VM = V(M) - V(P).


    * - If k=2
      - VM = V(M) - V(P).

    * - n
      - Unit vector normal to the 2D plane parent clip
        part.

    * - :math:`Î¸_M`
      - Angle between VM and PM. Because -1 < sin(QM) < 1
        (and n is a unit vector), then
        -1 < :math:`{\Gamma }_{k}\left(P\right)` < 1.


.. list-table:: **Function arguments**
    :widths: 30 70

    * - velocity
      - vector variable
    * - gamma function number
      - single integer (k=1 or k= 2) that determines
        which value of VM to use.

        A value of 1 is useful for finding vortex cores (centers).

        A value of 2 is useful for finding vortex boundaries.

    * - proximity radius
      - Float value greater than or equal to 0.0 that is used to
        determine the proximity area around each base node or element P over
        which the vorticity gamma is calculated on the 2D part clip.

        The larger the proximity radius, the more
        nodes (or elements) that are used to calculate G and the slower the
        calculation. A proximity radius less than or equal to 0.0
        always uses a proximity area of only elements that contain P and is
        the lower bound of this parameter, resulting in the smallest
        proximity area around P (and the fastest calculation). A radius of
        0.0 is a good value for the first run.

        As the proximity radius approaches the parent plane size
        this calculation approaches using every node (or element) in
        the calculation for each node (or element) resulting in a n2
        operation whose solution may be measured in calendar time
        rather than wristwatch time.

        The radius should be large enough to sample
        sufficient elements for a meaningful average, but small enough so
        that the vortex result remains a local calculation reported at each
        element. Again, a radius of 0.0 is a good value for the first run.
        A radius with a small scaling of the element size is a good
        second run.

    * - proximity option
      - 0 to include all cells with any nodes in the proximity area.

        1 to include only cells entirely located in the proximity area.

        Use this option along with the radius to control the
        number of nodes (or elements) used in the calculation for each node
        (or element) P.

        Consider using option 0 as the radius gets small
        relative to element size and using option 1 as the radius is enlarged.
        At a minimum, the proximity area always include elements that
        contain P.


.. note::

    Recall that Ï is the rotation rate for the antisymmetrical part of
    the velocity gradient and that Î¼ is the eigenvalue of the symmetric part
    of the tensor. The local character of the flow may be classified for
    Î²2 in the following manner (based on figure 4 in [ref.2, 1425], which
    plots Î²2 as a function of the ratio of Ï /Î¼):

    Ï/Î¼ < 1: flow locally dominated by strain, Î²2 < 2/Ï

    Ï/Î¼ = 1: pure shear, Î²2 = 2/Ï

    Ï/Î¼ > 1: flow locally dominated by rotation, Î²2 > 2/Ï
