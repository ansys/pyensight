<override namespace="ensight.devsrf.axis">
<description>
Specifies the direction of the axis of revolution, or longitudinal axis, of the revolved part.

| This vector corresponds to the direction of the axis of revolution of the cylinder, cone, sphere, or revolution tool for any revolved surface created via these quadric tools.  Otherwise, this vector should be specified to coincide with the axis of revolution of the 2D parent part.
| This is the longitudinal axis about which the nodes of the selected part(s) are mapped to the computational developing cylinder; which cylinder is subsequently unrolled yielding the developed (unrolled) surface.

Args:
    p0:
        &#x27;dx&#x27; cartesian vector x, y, z components of the developing cylinder&#x27;s longitudinal axis
