Control the display and use of EnSight click and go handles for an object

EnSight allows for direct interaction with many objects via click and go handles.
The handles allow things like annotations and viewports to be moved or resized.
They allow for the adjustment of values for clip planes and palette dynamic ranges.
In some situations, allowing the user to directly adjust these values can be
undesirable.  Setting this attribute to zero disables display of and interaction
with click and go handles for the specific object instance.
